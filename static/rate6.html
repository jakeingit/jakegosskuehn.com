			**not yet implemented mockup**
			This will be the longest game of "Keep The Ball In The Air As Long As Possible"... where you can win some money...
			This will go hand in hand with the backend and IAP structure for the penny stocks but this is a whole other thought experiment.
			<br>
			<br>
			Each user can buy some 'Presses', maybe 1$ for 100 presses. One penny each. These Presses can be used to press down on a button. The app is just a single button with a text box at the top and bottom.
			<br>
			<br>
			The bottom textbox is a timer that will be in seconds. The text box at the top shows the total POOL of money spent into this game. Yes. You can guess that the LAST person to press down on the app before the app runs out of time will win something. What will they win?
			<br>
			<br>
			Everything.

			<br>
			If you're the last person to press down on the button and the time runs out. I am guaranteeing that you will get 100% of all profit generated from the app. The only issue is that I may end up having so much money, which will be counted as revenue. I will be charged for sales for the IAP, and will be taxed. I must set up an agreement that makes sense.
			<br>
			The goal is not to make money, but I could take a 1% of the revenue as mine. The goal is to deliver a message. People are motivated by greed.
			<br>
			However, I believe human greed will take over. People will talk about this. This will go viral. This may spread. The higher the jackpot, the shorter the second timer will go. So instead of 60 seconds for the first few 10$ worth of presses, you'll have to bid every 30 seconds, then 20, 10, and every 1 second.

			But jake, people can't press the button EVERY second. Thats right, but I'll introduce a 'turn' order. Every person that presses down on the button QUEUEs up their Press. The person at the top of the Queue will AUTO-BID at the last 1 second. So potentially 1000of bids could be queued, but you will not know how many are being queued up.
			<br>
			<br>
			I am kind of banking on the idea that if you commit to this, you will not get outpressed by a backend robot that is given 1 billion free presses. I could, but that will distill any trust I have. I'll maybe post the code on Github so people can fact check my code.

			Out of all the projects on the rate pages, this is my favorite, but I dont think I'll implement this yet. I need to figure out the legality of it first. What if it never cashes out. I will have thousands of dollars sitting in a bank accrueing interest. It could get stolen. I could get screwed.

			I have a few different bundles. I honestly dont care if you buy a dollars worth of clicks or a dime's worth. I may just have this bit be remade, so you can choose the number of presses you want to buy for a penny each. 
			<br>
			<br>
			It would be nice if I figured out the legal side of it. Will I be taxed on the revenue if I purposely set aside each penny of it to give to a winner? They can be the one that gets taxed! I think the government might like this since its not a ponzi scheme, but will generate money if it takes off.
			<br>
			<br>
			I may include a 'tip' part, where 10% of your bids will be paid to me to maintain the server. </td>

			I think I need to run cron jobs which is a very energy/bandwidth intensive service. 
			<br>
			<br>
			It needs to update the website every single second to make sure everyone is seeing what everyone else is seeing.
			<br>
			<br>
			To monitize it without removing money from the prize pool, I may add an optional information feature that send an email to people when there are X amount of auto queued bids left and send that to everyone in the list, only if it reaches that going down. I wont mention that if it comes back up to 60.
			<br>
			<br>
			But I honestly dont want to make money with this. I want to see how large it can get. Can I also put the money in a savings account for the winner as well? I think that'll be smarter.
