				This app is intended for people who not only practice Lucid Dreaming, but want to take part in an experemental tool to help them traverse their own dreams.
				<br>
				<br>
				As long as the user doesn't 100% understand how the app's backend works, then they will have their mind think that this app will actually work. It really realies on their imagination, but then again, im targeting Lucid Dreamers.
				<br>
				<br>
				On this screen, you have a few default things you can do in a dream, but the app will only select and maintain one thing with one optional added descriptor.

			Literally does not do anything in real life, but the user will set their device. And when they choose a button, a HUGE button will show up on their phone. That size and text is all they need to remember in their dream.
			<br>
			<br>
			When you are dreaming, you may have your phone in your pocket. If you TRULY believe that this app works, either through good reviews or just faith, you will remember what button you chose and if you use your phone in your dream, may actually do the thing.

			When you wake up... Any time after noon, the app resets the choice so the user will go through the ritual right before they go to sleep. They will get a notification dialog in the app that asks if it worked.

			If they wrote anything, I will follow up with a RATE after 5 uses. If they rate 5 stars, I'll link to the play store for a real review.
